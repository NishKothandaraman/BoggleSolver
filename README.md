# BoggleSolver
Developed a Boggle Solver in C++ that finds all valid words in a given Boggle board in O(n*m) time,
where n is the number of words in the dictionary, and m is the length of longest string in the dictionary. A Trie data structure was used to store dictionary words, and recursion to find and print all valid words in the Boggle board.
